 conv.political.1.a:10 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 conv.political.1.b:10 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 conv.political.1.d:10 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 conv.political.1.t:10 "Communism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.c:10 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 conv.political.10.d:10 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 conv.political.10.t:10 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.11.c:10 "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 conv.political.11.d:10 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 conv.political.11.t:10 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.12.c:10 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 conv.political.12.d:10 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 conv.political.12.t:10 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.13.a:10 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 conv.political.13.b:10 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 conv.political.13.d:10 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 conv.political.13.t:10 "Communists Rise Up"
 conv.political.14.a:10 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 conv.political.14.b:10 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 conv.political.14.d:10 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 conv.political.14.t:10 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 conv.political.15.a:10 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 conv.political.15.b:10 "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.15.d:10 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 conv.political.15.t:10 "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 conv.political.16.a:10 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 conv.political.16.d:10 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 conv.political.16.t:10 "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 conv.political.17.a:10 "What a bunch of quitters."
 conv.political.17.d:10 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 conv.political.17.t:10 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 conv.political.18.a:10 "What a bunch of clowns."
 conv.political.18.d:10 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 conv.political.18.t:10 "Fascists Ridiculed"
 conv.political.19.a:10 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.19.t:10 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.19_communism:10 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. This country has always stood on it principles and been ready to defend them. We are no longer safe on our own. Neutrality is no longer the safe haven it used to be and those who seek power in this world do not respect it. We must stand with our communist brothers against the powers that seek to oppress us. Against the bourgeois majority who wants nothing more than keep us down. If we do not take a stand, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.19_fascism:10 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our fascist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.2.a:10 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 conv.political.2.b:10 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 conv.political.2.d:10 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 conv.political.2.t:10 "Move Towards Democracy"
 conv.political.3.a:10 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 conv.political.3.b:10 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 conv.political.3.d:10 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 conv.political.3.t:10 "Fascism on the Rise"
 conv.political.4.a:10 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 conv.political.4.d:10 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 conv.political.4.t:10 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:10 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.5.d:10 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 conv.political.5.t:10 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 conv.political.6.a:10 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 conv.political.6.d:10 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 conv.political.6.t:10 "The Threat of Communism"
 conv.political.7.a:10 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 conv.political.7.d:10 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 conv.political.7.t:10 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 conv.political.8.a:10 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 conv.political.8.d:10 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 conv.political.8.t:10 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 conv.political.9.a:10 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 conv.political.9.b:10 "Let the people be heard."
 conv.political.9.d:10 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 war_justification.236.d:10 "'Although we may be a peaceful people, our nature alone does not determine the course we must take in history. This is a time of war. For too long, the [Root.GetAdjective] have possessed the means that we need to make it through the trials we may face, and it's apparent that they will not part with them peacefully. Despite our best efforts to build a modern state, some matters can only be settled through the old trials of battle.'\n\nIn a recent speech to the [From.GetAdjective] people the hostile rhetoric towards [Root.GetName] has intensified and [From.GetLeader] has gone to great lengths to justify an invasion. Some portion of the population support this course, but the decision lies in the lands of their leader."

 war_justification.24.d:10 "'While we have consolidated the socialist society in [Root.GetName], many nations still suffer under the despots of old. The workers of [From.GetName] have no voice, no means to organize, and any attempts to institute socialism will be crushed savagely by the [From.GetLeader] regime. We cannot wait for the gears of the international revolution to turn for the [From.GetAdjective] people. With the revolution we have proven that we could crush the capitalist oppressors here, and we will crush the oppressors in [From.Capital.GetName] as well!'\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has abandoned all attempts at diplomatic rhetoric towards [From.GetRulingParty]-controlled [From.GetName]. The quest to eradicate all borders is now strictly focused on eradicating their borders."

 war_justification.25.a:10 "They follow a violent ideology, what reaction can they expect but violence?"
 war_justification.25.d:10 "'Without a doubt, [From.GetName] communism is one of the greatest threats to liberty and order in this era. Relentless and ruthless, it threatens to devour not only the [From.GetAdjective] people's hope of a prosperous, democratic society, but that of its neighbors as well. If we do not act now, we may well see this first domino fall too late, leaving more failed social experiments in its wake. How many more need die before we intervene?'\n\nThe threat of subversive activity undermining our democracy, fueled by [From.GetAdjective] ambitions, has become a hotly debated topic recently. While representatives in opposition have called this a Red Scare aimed at pursuing war with [From.GetName], the rhetoric of the [Root.GetRulingParty] has been highly successful so far."
 war_justification.25.t:10 "[Root.GetLeader] Speaks Against Red Menace"
 war_justification.26.a:10 "[From.GetName] is a dubious democracy anyway."
 war_justification.26.d:10 "'It is with heavy heart that we must confront the reality of our situation: An invasion of [From.GetName] may be our only recourse. It is of too great a strategic advantage to attempt any other solution in our current situation. Although we trust that neither the [Root.GetAdjective] nor the [From.GetAdjective] people want war, but history has led us to this point and our options are limited. We can only hope that through this assertion of our military power, we can avoid further bloodshed in the future.'\n\nAlthough it is a popular theory that democracies do not go to war against other democracies, recent developments have pointed to a [Root.GetAdjective] invasion of [From.GetName] in the future. History may surprise us yet."

 war_justification.27.a:10 "There can be no peace in our time until they are gone."
 war_justification.27.d:10 "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [From.GetRulingParty] now holds [From.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [From.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nPeople who have long hoped to avoid a direct confrontation with [From.GetName] have now been strongly opposed by [Root.GetLeader], who argues that we in Machiavellian terms are merely postponing war to the advantage of the enemy. At this rate, we may strike the first blow after all."

 war_justification.28.d:10 "'Despite our attempts to find a diplomatic solution to our conflict with [From.GetName], negotiations have once again broken down, leaving us with limited options. The authoritarian [From.GetLeader] regime has displayed the unreasonable approach to this matter typical of leaders who are not accountable to their people. Barring a complete turnaround in the policies of [From.GetAdjective] leadership, we will be left with no recourse but to fight.'\n\n[Root.GetAdjective] intervention in [From.GetName] has been a hot issue, with some politicians in the opposition claiming that [Root.GetRulingParty] has pursued a hawkish policy from the start. Whatever their original intent, a future war now suddenly seems very real and inevitable."

 war_justification.29.d:10 "'Is there a bigger threat to our way of life, or indeed the way of life itself, than communism? This plague that threatens to make the slaves, not the masters, rule every nation, to abolish the nation itself, to abolish people and their history. We will take [From.GetName] and abolish the communist plague.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s hatred of communists has been well known since before [Root.GetRulingParty]'s rise to power, but it appears to have intensified recently in the specific case of the [From.GetAdjective] government. Our quest to purge Marxism off the face of the Earth may start there."

 war_justification.30.d:10 "'The [From.GetAdjective] claim to have liberty and democracy, claim to want peace, but all of these things they pride themselves on are hollow. Their democracy divides the people where it should stand united and their liberty only betrays a lack of discipline. We [Root.GetAdjective]s see through these lies... and we can see that this peace, peace on their terms, is a lie as well.'\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] has long derided the weakness of the [From.GetAdjective] nation, but lately the rhetoric has grown more aggressive. The day of armed conflict grows closer."

We must steel ourselves for the struggle to come. For [From.GetName] will not be taken without a fight.'\n\nThe possibility of an understanding between the similarly minded governments of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] has given way to a campaign to take their territory by force."

Let us ask ourselves a better question: Does the future belong to the [From.GetAdjective] or does it belong to [Root.GetNameDef]?'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech today suggested that [Root.GetName] is on the path to war. Political tensions have been building over the past month and it seems the [Root.GetAdjective] people are coming to accept that war is inevitable."

[From.GetName] has had its traditions destroyed and rightful rulers long since murdered and buried, all in the name of the idea of the great Marxist revolution. It is our duty to restore order to this world led astray by bloodthirsty usurpers and to assert the strength of [Root.GetName] against this threat.'\n\nWhile the [Root.GetRulingParty] has always opposed communism, [From.GetName] has been a target of particular attacks in recent speeches. Whether or not the attack on the [Root.GetAdjective] nation from communists is a real threat, the preemptive attack on [From.GetAdjective] communism is already in the works."

 war_justification.34.d:10 "'[From.GetName] may think themselves more modern and advanced than us, but the truth is that their nation has not been tested as ours has, nor are they prepared for the threats now plain to see on the horizon. By their disdain towards us, and preventing us to seize that which is rightfully ours, they have made us one of those threats to themselves. Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [From.GetName] long held by the [Root.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility. Although popular opinion is that the [From.GetAdjective] people want to avoid war, [Root.GetLeader] claims that their elected leaders have provoked it through their arrogance."

While [From.GetLeader]'s successes are the result of a recent fad, a destructive mass movement bent on bullying other nations into submission, the [Root.GetRulingParty] stands in opposition to that movement as the ones who will not submit. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate this threat, even if it means war.'\n\nThe [Root.GetLeader] regime has adopted a hostile policy towards the [From.GetAdjective] nation.
